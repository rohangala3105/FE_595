The project contains 4 main files namely :
1) Credentials.py
2) First_script_They Fight Crime NLP.py
3) Second_script.py
4) Third_Script.py

The first step should be to enter your stevens credentials in the credentials.py file where in there are 2 functions:
one returning username(enter your stevens username here)
and the second funtion returns password(enter your setevens password here}

Moving ahead you will have to change the download path for your system, which can be done in line 12 of First_script_They Fight Crime NLP.py
Make sure that you set the path as the path of the current folder. This helps as you won't have to change anything in the Second & Thrid Script.

The output will be printed on the output console of your IDE.
